    "To create a quantum computer, we need to control - typically discrete, even more typically two - states of a quantum system. With neutral-atom technology, we use the electronic degrees of freedom of atoms themselves. These electrons are bound to nuclei and have energy levels fixed in specific orbitals. While complications arise atoms with large nuclei and many electrons, this simplified view is generally a good approximation at least when dealing with the least-bound electrons, some times known as valence electrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "These atomic excitation levels can be controlled by lasers. When applying coherent light with specific frequencies to the atoms, their electrons can absorb the corresponding energy transitioning between states. For QuEra's first generations of technology, we are focusing on rubidium (Rb) 87. Here is where it is located in the periodic table:"

    "The key observation is that because Rb is situated in the first column of the Periodic Table, it contains only a single electron in its outermost shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "When resonant light is applied to these Rb atoms, the outermost shell electron moves from its ground state $| g \\rangle$ state (a 5S state, with principal quantum number $n=5$) to more energetic states. For quantum computing with neutral atoms, a key set of higher-energy states are those with large principal quantum number. These are known as Rydberg states, which we will label $| r \\rangle$. In QuEra's analog quantum computers, we use 70S states (principal quantum number $n=70$). Using these two states, our Rb atoms act like qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of the quantum electronic clouds around an atom is tied to the atom's degree of excitation. In essence, the excited atom puffs up, increasing the probability of finding the electron at much larger radii. A fun physics fact is that the polarizability of a neutral body grows with its volume. This means that atoms in a Rydberg state (at times called Rydberg atoms), can interact much more strongly via dipolar forces than when in their ground state. This strong interaction is what we use to generate entanglement and perform quantum calculations."

    ">Transitions between different electronic states are implemented by absorption and emission of photons. When an atom is in the presence of light with the same energy as a particular energy transition, it (quantumly) absorbs or emits a photon to change between a ground and excited state. \n",
    ">For this process to be coherent, the photons’ electromagnetic field must be frequency stabilized to within ∼ 10 kHz, less than 1 part in $10^{11}$, and is generated by ultra-stable lasers frequency locked to a cavity. This is a challenge of neutral-atom quantum systems: to have a high-fidelity quantum computer, these lasers must be simultaneously ultra-stable and deliver high power. A recent enabling technology has been the development of such lasers, which are highly stable, have the suitable wavelength, and have powers of order 100s of watts.\n"
